\noindent This section lists all the variables which are assigned storage by thorn CactusPUGH/PUGHReduce.  Storage can either last for the duration of the run ({\bf Always} means that if this thorn is activated storage will be assigned, {\bf Conditional} means that if this thorn is activated storage will be assigned for the duration of the run if some condition is met), or can be turned on for the duration of a schedule function.
